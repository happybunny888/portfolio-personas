			<h5 style="color:#dffd37;text-align:center;"><strong>Possible Additions:</strong> </h5>	
				<h5 style="color:#dffd37;text-align:left;"> This Brown parking meter was used by primarily of persona 1 type, for prospective-applying students and their family.
					It is also very specifically different from regular street parking meters. 
					I think it would be great if I could add a section that compares the visual design of the two meters and interview/observe people who use both.
			</h5>
			<br>
			<h5 style="color:#dffd37;text-align:center;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> </h5>
			<h5 style="color:#dffd37;text-align:left;"> Public interfaces should be easy to use and accessible to a variety of people. Parking meters are used by many different people
				in the world, and use varying from either on a single occasion to a regular daily basis.
